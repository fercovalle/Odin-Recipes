    <p>
      Pizza is a baked flatbread made with wheat flour, salt, water, and yeast
      and topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients such as cheese, salami,
      mushrooms, onion, ham, or olives. Original from Neapolitan cuisine
      (Italy), it has become very popular all over the world and presents many
      different variants.

        Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium bowl,
        dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a
        round. Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel
        dusted with cornmeal. Spread with desired toppings and bake in preheated
        oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool
        for 5 minutes before serving.
