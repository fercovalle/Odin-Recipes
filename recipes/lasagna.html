        Once you have prepared the meat sauce and cheeses, you’re ready to
        layer. This is the order of layers: sauce – noodles – cheese sauce –
        noodles – cheese sauce – noodles – cheese noodles – sauce (bake) –
        cheese
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>Top the noodles with some of the cheese mixture.</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
      <li>
        Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan and bake another 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <h2>How Long to Bake</h2>
      <p>

        for another 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and your easy
        lasagna is bubbling.
